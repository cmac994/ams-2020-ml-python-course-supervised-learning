## Supervised learning 

This module uses basic ML models â€“ linear regression (LR), logistic regression, suport-vector machines (SVM), decision trees (DT), random forests (RF), and gradient-boosted trees (GB) to predict surface conditions at select Weather Challenge METAR sites.

### Regression

Caption: A variety of supervised machine learning techniques are applied to predict maximum temperature at KROA (Roanoke-Blacksburg Airport, VA) between 2018-2019.
Each model was trained using NWP model forecast data retrieved between 2011 and 2017. The comparison in mean squared error and the percentile absolute error difference highlights the power of machine learning to constrain variance. For more details see notebook!

### Classification
<img width="1600" height="400" src="Figures/Figure7.png">

Caption: Binary classification performance for precipitation prediction at KROA over the testing period (2018-2019). Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves are displayed on the left while Detection Error Tradeoff (DET) curves are shown on the right. Both plots show that machine learning models, in particular gradient boosting, outperform NWP in terms of precipitation prediction (i.e. precipitation = 1, no precipitatio = 0) on any given day. For more details see notebook! 

### Module Setup

If using google colab, simply load the .ipynb notebook into colab and begin. 

Alternatively, if you'd like to run these notebooks in jupyter, you'll need to ensure all necessary packages are installed.
This can be easily accomplished by setting up a new conda enivonrment with all the relevant packages.

Such an environment can be created from the yml file included in this repository. To create a new environment run the following command(s) from the terminal.

1) Create the environment
   - *conda env create -f ml_tutorial.yml*

2) Activate the environment
   - *conda activate ml_tutorial*
