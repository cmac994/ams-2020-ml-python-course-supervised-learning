Supervised learning 


### Setup

If using google colab, simply load the .ipynb notebook into colab and begin. 

Alternatively, if you'd like to run these notebooks in jupyter, you'll need to ensure all necessary packages are installed.
This can be easily accomplished by setting up a new conda enivonrment with all the relevant packages.

Such an environment can be created from the yml file included in this repository. To create a new environment run the following command(s) from the terminal.

1) Create the environment
   - *conda env create -f ml_tutorial.yml*

2) Activate the environment
  - *conda activate ml_tutorial*
